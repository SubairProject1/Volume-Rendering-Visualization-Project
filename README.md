# Volume-Rendering-Visualization-Project
Project for the Visualization course, implemented in a group of three. We built a WebGL-based volume rendering system using GPU raycasting, including a density histogram, cutting plane integration, an interactive editor, and transfer-function–based isosurface visualization.
